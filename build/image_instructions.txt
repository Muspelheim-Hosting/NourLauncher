NSIS Installer Image Files
======================================

To complete the NSIS installer customization, please create the following files:

1. header.bmp
   - Location: build/header.bmp
   - Size: 150x57 pixels
   - Format: BMP (24-bit color)
   - Purpose: Header image that appears at the top of the installer

2. sidebar.bmp
   - Location: build/sidebar.bmp  
   - Size: 164x314 pixels
   - Format: BMP (24-bit color)
   - Purpose: Left sidebar image for welcome and finish pages

3. icon.ico
   - Location: build/icon.ico
   - Format: ICO file with multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 pixels)
   - Important: Must be a valid Windows ICO format
   - Purpose: Installer icon
   
4. uninstall.ico
   - Location: build/uninstall.ico
   - Format: ICO file with multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 pixels)
   - Important: Must be a valid Windows ICO format
   - Purpose: Uninstaller icon

IMPORTANT FOR ICONS:
-------------------
1. Create a PNG image of your logo in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
2. Convert to ICO format using a tool like:
   - Online converters: https://convertico.com/ or https://icoconvert.com/
   - Desktop software: GIMP, Photoshop with ICO plugin, or IcoFX
3. Make sure to include multiple sizes in one ICO file
4. Use 32-bit depth (RGBA) to support transparency

Until valid icon files are created, the installer settings have been modified to use default icons.

Design Recommendations:
-------------------
- Use the Void Event Hub color scheme and branding
- For the header, include your logo and name
- For the sidebar, consider a vertical banner with key features
- Use high-quality transparent icons for the .ico files
- Ensure all images match the specified dimensions exactly

Once created, place them in the build/ directory and uncomment the related settings in electron-builder.js.
