NSIS Installer Image Files
======================================

To complete the NSIS installer customization, please create the following files:

1. header.bmp
   - Location: build/header.bmp
   - Size: 150x57 pixels
   - Purpose: Header image that appears at the top of the installer

2. sidebar.bmp
   - Location: build/sidebar.bmp  
   - Size: 164x314 pixels
   - Purpose: Left sidebar image for welcome and finish pages

3. icon.ico
   - Location: build/icon.ico
   - Purpose: Installer icon
   
4. uninstall.ico
   - Location: build/uninstall.ico

Design Recommendations:
- Use the Void Event Hub color scheme and branding
- For the header, include your logo and name
- For the sidebar, consider a vertical banner with key features
- Use high-quality transparent icons for the .ico files
- Ensure all images match the specified dimensions exactly

You can create these files using image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools.

Once created, place them in the build/ directory to complete the NSIS installer customization.
